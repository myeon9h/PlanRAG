Each connection has a unique \"base_trading_power\" for each node. \n\nIf a specific node is the home node of a country, that country earns profit from that node. The profit is proportional to the \u201dlocal_value\u201d plus \u201cingoing\u201d and the ratio of the country's trading power and the total trading power of that node. i.e. (local_value+ingoing)*(country_trading_power/total_trading_power)\n\nIf a specific node is upstream of a country's home node, the country moves a value to downstream node, proportional to the ratio of the country's trading power to the node's total trading power and (\u201dlocal_value\u201d + \u201cingoing\u201d). In the downstream node, the moved value is increased by 1.05 times and added to the \u201dingoing\u201d.\n\nA \"Merchant\" belongs to a country and can be assigned to a specific trading node. A \"Merchant\" belonging to a trading node adds 2 to the trading power of the country's trading node and amplifies it by 1.05 times. *If one of the edges has an inland node, the added value changes to 2+max(development/3, 50). (optional)*\n\nIf a specific trading node has more than one downstream node, and a country that doesn't have that node as its home node places a \"Merchant\" on the Trading node, it can decide which downstream node to move the \"current_value\" to. That is, the country can move a \"current_value\" proportional to its trading power to a specific downstream node. If no merchant is placed, when there's more than one downstream node, they lose the right to decide the direction. In other words, the country's \"current_value\" proportional to its trading power flows out in proportion to other outflows to the downstream nodes.
