context = """================
<Context>
Money in this global trade network can flow between trade nodes in unidirectional trade routes as well as terminate at end nodes.
Trade value represents the monthly sum of locally produced and incoming trade goods in a trade node. 
Trade power is a number representing a country's control over trade in a node. The trade power of a country as a proportion of the total trade power of all countries present in the node determines what will happen to the trade value in each node. Power is used either to retain trade value within the node (if the nation is collecting with a merchant or at its home node), or to transfer it forward in the trade network (if the nation is steering from there with a merchant, or it's not its home node and it has no merchant). Trade power is generated by provinces, light ships, and merchants.
Merchants can be sent to a trade node to collect a portion of the node's trade value proportional to the nation's share of trade power in the node, or steer the node's trade value in a particular direction.
In the absence of merchants, countries collect trade in their home node, have no influence on trade flow in non-home nodes not upstream from their trade collection, and pull trade forward in all other nodes to increase the transferred trade value.
Merchants can be sent on missions to collect trade, retaining it as income, or to steer trade to influence its flow. Sending merchants to nodes other than the home node incurs a penalty to trade power."""

<Strategy>
These are the famous strategies to raise overall profit.
1. It is highly encouraged to place merchants on directly connected nodes.
2. It is advantageous to place merchants on nodes with high local value."""
