Supply has \"max_supply\", \"current_output\", and \"level\". The level here is the same as the level of the Building. Furthermore, max_supply and level have a proportional relationship.\nThere exists a relation called Demand from Goods to Buildings. Demand has \"max_demand\", \"current_input\", and \"level\". Also, max_demand and level have a proportional relationship.\nThe demand of Goods is defined as the Goods' \"pop_demand\" plus sum of the \"max_demand\" of all Demands connected to the Goods.\nThe supply of Goods is defined by the sum of \"current_output\" of all Supplies connected to Goods.\nThe \"current_input\" of Demand is determined by the ratio of connected Building's \"max_demand\" to connected Goods' demand, and multiplied by the supply of Goods.\nThe \"current_output\" of Supply is determined by the average ratio of the connected Building's \"current_input\" to connected Goods' \"max_demand\", and multiplied by the \"max_supply\" of Supply.\nThe \"current_price\" of Goods is determined by base_price*(1+0.75(demand-supply)/max(demand,supply)).",
