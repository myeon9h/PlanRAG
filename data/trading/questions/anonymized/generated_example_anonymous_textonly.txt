problem number #4

AI: Based on the given information, the best option for the ruler of "CCODE174" to allocate their merchant to steer trade to "N18" would be option 3, N20.

The reason for this choice is that "N20" is directly connected to "N18" and can directly steer trade towards the home node. Additionally, the trade value in "N20" is relatively high at 86.230, indicating that there is a significant amount of trade that can be directed towards "N18". By allocating the merchant to steer trade from "N20" to "N18", the ruler of "CCODE174" can maximize their profit on their home node.

The other options, N19, N10, and N21, are not directly connected to "N18" and would require trade to flow through additional nodes before reaching the home node. Additionally, the trade values in these nodes are relatively lower compared to "N20". Therefore, choosing any of these options would result in a less efficient flow of trade towards "N18" and potentially lower profit for the ruler of "CCODE174".

N20
        

problem number #5

AI: The answer is option 3: N12.

Allocating your merchant to steer trade to N12 would be the best option for maximizing your profit on N19. This is because N12 is directly connected to your home node, N19. By steering trade to N12, you can ensure that a portion of the trade value from N19 flows directly to N12, increasing the trade value in your home node.

On the other hand, N22, N23, and N18 are not directly connected to N19. Sending your merchant to these nodes would result in a penalty to trade power and a lower ability to steer trade towards your home node. Therefore, choosing N12, which is directly connected to N19, would be the most effective way to maximize your profit.

Gold answer:
N18
        

problem number #6

AI: The answer is 2. N26.

Allocating the merchant to steer trade to N26 will be the most beneficial option in terms of maximizing profit on N24. 

Based on the given information, N26 has a high current money value of 3.327 and a relatively high local trade value of 3.309. Additionally, N26 has a relatively low retention ratio of 0.472, indicating that a significant portion of the trade value can be steered to other nodes.

By allocating the merchant to steer trade to N26, you can increase the incoming trade value to N26, which will in turn increase the outgoing trade value from N26. As N26 is directly connected to your home node N24, the increased outgoing trade value from N26 will flow directly into your home node, maximizing your profit on N24.

Other nodes like N25, N11, and N27 may have higher current money values, but they either have high retention ratios or are not directly connected to your home node. Therefore, allocating the merchant to steer trade to N26 is the most optimal choice for maximizing profit on N24.

Gold answer:
N26
        

problem number #7

AI: Based on the given information, the best option for you to allocate your merchant to steer trade to "N23" would be N26. 

Here's the reasoning behind this choice:

1. N19 has a high retention ratio of 0.822, meaning a large portion of the trade value stays within the node. Steering trade from N19 may not result in a significant increase in transferred trade value to N23.

2. N28 has a relatively low retention ratio of 0.931, which is good for trade flow. However, N28 is not directly connected to N23. Steering trade from N28 to N23 would require trade to flow through other nodes, which may result in trade value loss along the way.

3. N26 has a retention ratio of 0.472, indicating that a significant portion of the trade value can be steered to other nodes. Additionally, N26 is directly connected to N23, making it an ideal choice for steering trade to your home node.

4. N24 also has a retention ratio of 0.472, but it is not directly connected to N23. Similar to N28, steering trade from N24 to N23 would require trade to flow through other nodes, potentially resulting in trade value loss.

Therefore, to maximize your profit on N23, you should allocate your merchant to steer trade from N26 to N23.

Gold answer:
N26
        

problem number #8

AI: The answer would be 4. N11.

problem number #9

AI: The answer is N31. 

To maximize your profit on N30, you should allocate your merchant to steer trade to N31. This is because N31 has the highest trade value (current money value) among the available options. By steering trade to N31, you can increase the trade value in N30, which will ultimately maximize your profit. N32, N28, and N33 have lower trade values, so allocating your merchant to steer trade to any of these nodes would not be as beneficial in terms of maximizing your profit on N30.

Gold answer:
N32
        

problem number #10

AI: Based on the given information, the best option for you, as the ruler of CCODE109, would be to allocate your merchant to steer trade to N14.

The reason for this choice is that N14 is directly connected to your home node, N12. Steering trade to N14 will allow you to have control over the trade flow between these two nodes and maximize your profit in your home node. Additionally, N14 has a relatively high trade value, which means there is potential for significant profit by steering trade towards it.

On the other hand, N9 and N35 are not directly connected to your home node, and steering trade towards these nodes would not directly benefit your profits in N12. N0 is connected to N12, but it already has a high trade value and is not the best option for maximizing your profit.

Therefore, allocating your merchant to steer trade to N14 would be the most strategic choice in order to maximize your profit in your home node, N12.

Gold answer:
N14
        

problem number #11

AI: The answer would be option 2, N12. 

This choice is based on the principle of steering trade towards the home node, which in this case is N14. By allocating the merchant to N12, it will be able to steer the trade from N12 towards N14, increasing the trade value in N14. Since the goal is to maximize profit in N14, choosing N12 as the destination for the merchant is the best option.

Gold answer:

problem number #12

AI: Based on the given information, the best option for you as the ruler of "CCODE613" would be to allocate your merchant to steer trade to "N36". This is because your goal is to maximize your profit on your home node, which is "N36". By steering trade to your home node, you will be able to collect a portion of the trade value in that node proportional to your trade power. This will result in increased income for your country. 

Therefore, the answer is 4. N40

Gold answer:
N40
        

problem number #13

AI: The best option for you to allocate your merchant to steer trade to "N25" would be option 1, N9.

The reason for this is that N9 is directly connected to your home node, N25. By sending your merchant to N9, you can steer the trade value directly to your home node, increasing the transferred trade value and ultimately maximizing your profit on N25.

The other options (N10, N5, and N43) are not directly connected to your home node, so steering trade from those nodes would require additional steps and potentially incur penalties to trade power. Therefore, N9 is the most efficient and profitable choice for you to allocate your merchant.

Gold answer:
N9
        

problem number #14

AI: The answer is 4. N17. The reason for this choice is that N17 is directly connected to our home node, N15. By sending the merchant to N17, we can steer trade directly towards our home node and maximize our profit on N15. Additionally, N17 has a higher trade value compared to the other nodes, which means there is more potential profit to be gained by steering trade towards N15 from N17.

problem number #16

AI: Based on the given information, it would be most beneficial for CCODE53 to allocate their merchant to steer trade to N41.

1. N8: Steering trade to N8 would not be the best option because it has a high retention ratio (0.487), meaning that a significant portion of the trade value would be retained within the node and not transferred to N9. Additionally, N8 already has a relatively high current money value (2.473) compared to the other nodes.

2. N41: N41 has a lower retention ratio (0.393) compared to N8, indicating that it is easier to steer trade value out of this node. It also has a relatively high current money value (1.787) and a high local trade value (3.202). By allocating the merchant to steer trade to N9 from N41, CCODE53 can potentially increase the trade value flowing into their home node, maximizing their profit.

3. N45: N45 has a high retention ratio (0.742), indicating that it is more difficult to steer trade value out of this node. Although it has a relatively high current money value (1.902), its local trade value (2.512) is lower compared to N41. Allocating the merchant to steer trade from N45 to N9 may not result in as much profit as steering from N41.

4. N46: N46 has a slightly lower retention ratio (0.784) compared to N45, but its current money value (6.162) is significantly higher. However, N46 does not have as high of a local trade value (5.534) as N41. Additionally, since N46 is directly connected to N9, it is likely that trade value from N46 will already be flowing towards N9. Therefore, allocating the merchant to steer trade from N46 may not be as effective in maximizing profit compared to N41.

Based on these factors, the best option for CCODE53 would be to allocate their merchant to steer trade to N9 from N41.
